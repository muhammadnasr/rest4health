# Welcome to Rest4Health!

This is my first project in Python. It is built with Django and it is dockerized.

# How to run

 1. clone project
 2. rename .env-sample to .env
 3. run `docker-compose up`
 4. To add new users go to standard django admin portal [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and login using admin/123456 (or whatever password in .env)
